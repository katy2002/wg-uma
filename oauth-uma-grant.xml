    <abstract>
      <t>This specification defines a means for a client, representing a
      requesting party, to use a permission ticket to request an OAuth 2.0
      access token to gain access to a protected resource asynchronously from
      the time a resource owner authorizes access.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

  <middle>
    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>This specification defines an extension OAuth 2.0 <xref
      target="RFC6749" /> grant. The grant enhances OAuth capabilities in the
      following ways:<list style="symbols">
          <t>The resource owner authorizes protected resource access to
          clients used by entities that are in a <spanx>requesting
          party</spanx> role. This enables party-to-party authorization,
          rather than authorization of application access alone.</t>

          <t>The authorization server and resource server interact with the
          client and requesting party in a way that is
          <spanx>asynchronous</spanx> with respect to resource owner
          interactions. This lets a resource owner configure an authorization
          server with authorization grant rules (policy conditions) at will,
          rather than authorizing access token issuance synchronously just
          after authenticating.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>For example, bank customer (resource owner) Alice with a bank account
      service (resource server) can use a sharing management service
      (authorization server) hosted by the bank to manage access to her
      various protected resources by spouse Bob, accounting professional
      Charline, and and financial information aggregation company Decide
      Account, all using different client applications. Each of her bank
      accounts is a protected resource, and two different scopes of access she
      can control on them are viewing account data and accessing payment
      functions.</t>

      <t>An OPTIONAL second specification, <xref target="UMAFedAuthz" />,
      defines a means for an UMA-enabled authorization server and resource
      server to be loosely coupled, or federated, in a resource owner context.
      This specification, together with <xref target="UMAFedAuthz" />,
      constitutes UMA 2.0.</t>

      <section title="Notational Conventions">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
        "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
        <xref target="RFC2119" />.</t>

        <t>Unless otherwise noted, all parameter names and values are case
        sensitive. JSON <xref target="RFC7159" /> data structures defined in
        this specification MAY contain extension parameters that are not
        defined in this specification. Any entity receiving or retrieving a
        JSON data structure SHOULD ignore extension parameters it is unable to
        understand. Extension names that are unprotected from collisions are
        outside the scope of this specification.</t>

            for limited legal purposes (legal person), such as a
            corporation.</t>

            <t hangText="requesting party"><vspace />A natural or legal person
            that uses a client to seek access to a protected resource. The

            <t hangText="client"><vspace />An application that is capable of
            making requests for protected resources with the resource owner's
            authorization and on the requesting party's behalf.</t>

            <t hangText="resource server"><vspace />A server that hosts
            resources on a resource owner's behalf and is capable of accepting
            and responding to requests for protected resources.</t>

            <t hangText="authorization server"><vspace />A server that
            protects, on a resource owner's behalf, resources hosted at a
            resource server.</t>

      </section>

      <section anchor="high-level-flow" title="Abstract Flow">
        <t>The UMA grant enhances the abstract protocol flow of OAuth.</t>

        <t><xref target="protocol-flow" /> shows an example flow illustrating
        a variety of messaging paths and artifacts. The resource owner entity
        and its communications with the authorization server are included for
        completeness, although policy condition setting is outside the scope
        of this specification and communications among the other four entities
        are asynchrjonous with respect to resource owner actions. Further,
        although both claims pushing and interactive claims gathering are
        shown, both might not typically be used in one scenario.</t>

        <t>Following are key concepts relevant to this specification, as
        illustrated in the figure:<list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="requesting party token (RPT)">An OAuth access token
            associated with the UMA grant. An RPT is unique to a requesting
            party, client, authorization server, resource server, and resource
            owner.</t>

            <t hangText="permission">Authorized access to a particular
            resource with some number of scopes bound to that resource. A
            permission ticket represents some number of requested permissions.
            An RPT represents some number of granted permissions. Permissions
            are part of the authorization server's process and are opaque to
            the client.</t>

            <t hangText="permission ticket">A correlation handle representing
            requested permissions that is created and maintained by the
            authorization server, initially passed to the client by the
            resource server, and presented by the client at the token endpoint
            and during requesting party redirects.</t>

            <t hangText="authorization process">The process through which the
            authorization server determines whether it should issue an RPT to
            the client on the requesting party's behalf, based on a variety of
            inputs. A key component of the process is authorization
            assessment. (See <xref target="authorization-process" />.)</t>

            <t hangText="claim">A statement of the value or values of one or
            more attributes of an entity. The authorization server typically
            needs to collect and assess one or more claims of the requesting
            party or client against policy conditions as part of protecting a
            resource. The two methods available for UMA claims collection are
            claims pushing and interactive claims gathering. Note: Claims
            collection might involve authentication for unique user
            identification, but depending on policy conditions might
            additionally or instead involve the collection of non-uniquely
            identifying attributes, authorization for some action (for
            example, see <xref target="redirect-back" />), or other statements
            of agreement.</t>

            <t hangText="claim token">A package of claims provided directly by
            the client to the authorization server through claims pushing.</t>

            <t hangText="persisted claims token (PCT)">A correlation handle
            issued by an authorization server that represents a set of claims
            collected during one authorization process, available for a client
            to use in attempting to optimize a future authorization
            process.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Note: How the client acquired knowledge of the resource server's
        interface and the specific endpoint of the desired protected resource
        is outside the scope of this specification. For example, the resource
        server might have a programmatic API or it might serve up simple web
        pages, and the resource owner might have advertised the endpoint
        publicly on a blog or other website, listed it in a discovery service,
        or emailed a link to a particular intended requesting party.</t>

        <section anchor="authorization-process" title="Authorization Process">
          <t>The authorization process involves the following activities:<list
              style="symbols">
              <t>Claims collection. Claims pushing by a client is defined in
              <xref target="uma-grant-type" />, and interactive claims
              gathering with an end-user requesting party is defined in <xref
              target="claim-redirect" />.</t>

              <t>Authorization assessment (as defined in <xref
              target="authorization-assessment" />). Authorization assessment
              involves the authorization server assembling and evaluating
              policy conditions, scopes, claims, and any other relevant
              information sourced outside of UMA claims collection flows, in
              order to mitigate access authorization risk.</t>

              <t>Authorization results determination (as defined in <xref
              target="authorization-assessment" />). The authorization server
              either returns a success code (as defined in <xref
              target="give-rpt" />), an RPT, and an optional PCT, or an error
              code (as defined in <xref target="authorization-failure" />). If
              the error code is <spanx style="verb">need_info</spanx> or
              <spanx style="verb">request_submitted</spanx>, the authorization
              server provides a permission ticket, giving the client an
              opportunity to continue within the same authorization process
              (including engaging in further claims collection).</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Different choices of claims collection methods, other inputs to
          authorization assessment, and error codes might be best suited for
          different deployment ecosystems. For example, where no
          pre-established relationship is expected between the resource
          owner's authorization server and the requesting party, initial
          requesting party redirection might be a useful pattern, at which
          point the authorization server might either authenticate the
          requesting party locally or serve as a relying party for a remote
          identity provider. Where a common authorization server functions as
          an identity provider for all resource owners and requesting parties,
          having the client push claim tokens sourced from that central server
          itself with a pre-negotiated format and contents might be a useful
          pattern.</t>
        </section>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="as-config" title="Authorization Server Metadata">
      <t>The authorization server supplies metadata in a discovery document to
      declare its endpoints. The client uses this discovery document to
      discover these endpoints for use in the flows defined in <xref
      target="protocol-flow-details-sec" />.</t>

      <t>The authorization server MUST make a discovery document available.
      The structure of the discovery document MUST conform to that defined in
      <xref target="OAuthMeta" />. The discovery document MUST be available at
      an endpoint formed by concatenating the string <spanx
      style="verb">/.well-known/uma2-configuration</spanx> to the <spanx
      style="verb">issuer</spanx> metadata value defined in <xref
      target="OAuthMeta" />, using the well-known URI syntax and semantics
      defined in <xref target="RFC5785" />. In addition to the metadata
      defined in <xref target="OAuthMeta" />, this specification defines the
      following metadata for inclusion in the discovery document:<list
          hangIndent="6" style="hanging">
          <t hangText="claims_interaction_endpoint"><vspace />OPTIONAL. A
          static endpoint URI at which the authorization server declares that
          it interacts with end-user requesting parties to gather claims. If
          the authorization server also provides a claims interaction endpoint
          URI as part of its <spanx style="verb">redirect_user</spanx> hint in
          a <spanx style="verb">need_info</spanx> response to a client on
          authorization failure (see <xref target="authorization-failure" />),
          that value overrides this metadata value. Providing the static
          endpoint URI is useful for enabling interactive claims gathering
          prior to any pushed-claims flows taking place, for example, for
          gathering authorization for subsequent claim pushing (see <xref
          target="claim-redirect" />).</t>

          <t hangText="uma_profiles_supported"><vspace />OPTIONAL. UMA
          profiles and extensions supported by this authorization server. The
          value is an array of string values, where each string value is a URI
          identifying an UMA profile or extension. As discussed in <xref
          target="profiles" />, an authorization server supporting a profile
          or extension related to UMA SHOULD supply the specification's
          identifying URI (if any) here.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>If the authorization server supports dynamic client registration, it
      MUST allow client applications to register <spanx
      style="verb">claims_redirect_uri</spanx> metadata, as defined in <xref
      target="claim-redirect" />, using the following metadata field:<list
          hangIndent="6" style="hanging">
          <t hangText="claims_redirect_uris"><vspace />OPTIONAL. Array of one
          or more claims redirection URIs.</t>

        <t>The resource server responds to the client's tokenless resource
        request.</t>

        <t>The resource server MUST obtain a permission ticket from the
        authorization server to provide in its response, but the means of
        doing so is outside the scope of this specification. For an example of
        how the resource server can obtain the permission ticket, see <xref
        target="UMAFedAuthz" />.</t>

        <t>The process of choosing what permissions to request from the
        authorization server may require interpretation and mapping of the
        client's resource request. The resource server SHOULD request a set of
        permissions with scopes that is reasonable for the client's resource
        request.</t>

        <t>Note: In order for the resource server to know which authorization
        server to approach for the permission ticket and on which resource
        owner's behalf, it needs to derive the necessary information using
        cues provided by the structure of the API where the resource request
        was made, rather than by an access token. Commonly, this information
        can be passed through the URI, headers, or body of the client's
        request. Alternatively, the entire interface could be dedicated to the
        use of a single resource owner and protected by a single authorization
        server.</t>

        <t>Initiation of this process has two options. One option is for the

        defined in <xref target="uma-grant-type" />. Claim pushing is
        available at this endpoint. The other option, if the authorization

              containing directly pushed claim information in the indicated
              format. It MUST be base64url encoded unless specified otherwise
              by the claim token format. The client MAY provide this
              information on both first and subsequent requests to this
              endpoint. The client and authorization server together might
              need to establish proper audience restrictions for the claim
              token prior to claims pushing. See <xref target="trust-push" />
              and <xref target="rqp-privacy" /> for security and privacy
              considerations regarding pushing of claims.</t>

              the format of the claim token in which the client is directly
              pushing claims to the authorization server. The string MAY be a
              URI. Examples of potential types of claim token formats are
              <xref target="OIDCCore" /> ID Tokens and SAML assertions.</t>

              <t hangText="pct">OPTIONAL. If the authorization server
              previously returned a PCT along with an RPT, the client MAY
              include the PCT in order to optimize the process of seeking a
              new RPT. Given that some claims represented by a PCT are likely
              to contain identity information about a requesting party, a
              client supplying a PCT in its RPT request MUST make a best
              effort to ensure that the requesting party using the client now
              is the same as the requesting party that was associated with the
              PCT when it was issued. See <xref target="trust-push" /> and
              <xref target="rqp-privacy" /> for additional security and
              privacy considerations regarding persistence of claims. The
              client MAY use the PCT for the same requesting party when
              seeking an RPT for a resource different from the one sought when
              the PCT was issued, or a protected resource at a different
              resource server entirely. See <xref
              target="sec-consid-exposure" /> for additional PCT security
              considerations. See <xref target="give-rpt" /> for the form of
              the authorization server's response with a PCT.</t>

              <t hangText="rpt">OPTIONAL. Supplying an existing RPT (which MAY
              be expired) gives the authorization server the option of
              upgrading that RPT instead of issuing a new one (see <xref

              consider any requested scope in its assessment, the client MUST
              have been pre-registered for the same scope with the
              authorization server. The client should consult the resource
              server's API documentation for details about which scopes it can
              expect the resource server's initial returned permission ticket

          interactive claims-gathering processes as the authorization server
          requires. These can include direct interactions, such as account
          registration and authentication local to the authorization server as
          an identity provider, filling out a questionnaire, or asking the
          user to authorize subsequent collection of claims by interaction or
          pushing, and persistent storage of such claims (for example, as
          associated with a PCT). Interactions could also involve further
          redirection, for example, for federated (such as social)
          authentication at a remote identity provider, and other federated
          claims gathering. See <xref target="trust-push" /> and <xref

          regarding pushing and persistence of claims.</t>

          <t>The client might have initiated redirection immediately on

          <t>In order for the client to redirect the requesting party

              associated with a resource found in the permission ticket.</t>

              <t>For each <spanx>RequestedScopes(resource)</spanx> set,
              determine all operative policy conditions, and claims and other
              relevant information serving as input to them, and evaluate its
              authorization status.</t>

              <t>For each scope in <spanx>RequestedScopes(resource)</spanx>
              that passes the evaluation, add it to a set called
              <spanx>CandidateGrantedScopes(resource)</spanx>.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Note: Claims and other information gathered during one
          authorization process may become out of date in terms of their
          relevance for future authorization processes. The authorization
          server is responsible for managing such relevance wherever
          information associated with a PCT, or other persistently stored
          information, is used as input to authorization, including policy
          conditions themselves.</t>

          <t>Note: Since the authorization server's policy expression and
          evaluation capabilities are outside the scope of this specification,
          any one implementation might take a simple or arbitrarily complex
          form, with varying abilities to combine or perform calculations over
          claims and their values. For example, logical operations such as
          accepting "either claim value A or claim value B" as correct are
          possible to implement.</t>

          <t>In the authorization results phase, the authorization server
          examines each <spanx>CandidateGrantedScopes(resource)</spanx> set to
          determine whether to issue an RPT and what permissions should be
          associated with it. If all <spanx>RequestedScopes(resource)</spanx>
          sets can be granted, then the authorization server subsequently
          responds with a success code and issues an RPT containing
          <spanx>CandidateGrantedScopes</spanx> for each resource.</t>

          <t>Otherwise, the authorization server subsequently issues either an
          RPT containing <spanx>CandidateGrantedScopes</spanx> for each
          resource, or one of the error codes, as appropriate. The reason for
          the two options is that granting only partial scopes might not be
          useful for the client's and requesting party's purposes in seeking
          authorization for access. The choice of error depends on policy
          conditions and the authorization server's implementation choices.
          The conditions for the <spanx style="verb">need_info</spanx>, <spanx
          style="verb">request_denied</spanx>, and <spanx
          style="verb">request_submitted</spanx> error codes are dependent on
          authorization assessment and thus these codes might be more likely
          than the others to be issued subsequent to such a calculation.</t>

          <t>The following example illustrates authorization assessment and
          partial results. <list style="symbols">
              <t>The resource server has three of the resource owner's
              resources of interest to the client and requesting party, <spanx
              style="verb">photo1</spanx> and <spanx
              style="verb">photo2</spanx> with scopes <spanx
              style="verb">view</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">resize</spanx>,
              <spanx style="verb">print</spanx>, and <spanx
              style="verb">download</spanx>, and <spanx
              style="verb">album</spanx> with scopes <spanx
              style="verb">view</spanx>, <spanx style="verb">edit</spanx>, and
              <spanx style="verb">download</spanx>. It considers <spanx
              style="verb">photo1</spanx> and <spanx
              style="verb">photo2</spanx> to be logically "inside" <spanx
              style="verb">album</spanx>.</t>

              <t>Though the exact contents of RPTs, permissions, and
              permission requests are opaque to the client, the resource
              server has documented its API, available scopes, and permission
              requesting practices. For example, if the client requests an
              album resource, it expects that the resource server will request
              a permission for the album with a scope that approximates the
              attempted client operation, but will also request permissions
              for all the photos "inside" the album, with <spanx
              style="verb">view</spanx> scope only.</t>

              <t>The client has a pre-registered scope of <spanx
              style="verb">download</spanx> with the authorization server.
              This enables the client later to request this scope dynamically
              on behalf of its requesting party from the token endpoint. The
              authorization server assembles the set
              <spanx>RegisteredScopes</spanx> with contents of scope <spanx
              style="verb">download</spanx>.</t>

              <t>The client requests the album resource in an attempt to edit
              it, so the resource server obtains a permission ticket with
              three permissions in it: for <spanx style="verb">album</spanx>
              with a scope of <spanx style="verb">edit</spanx>, and for <spanx
              style="verb">photo1</spanx> and <spanx
              style="verb">photo2</spanx>, each with a scope of <spanx
              style="verb">view</spanx>. The authorization server assembles
              the following sets: <spanx>TicketScopes</spanx>(<spanx
              style="verb">album</spanx>) containing <spanx
              style="verb">edit</spanx>, <spanx>TicketScopes</spanx>(<spanx
              style="verb">photo1</spanx>) containing <spanx
              style="verb">view</spanx>, and
              <spanx>TicketScopes</spanx>(<spanx style="verb">photo2</spanx>)
              containing <spanx style="verb">view</spanx>.</t>

              <t>While asking for an RPT at the token endpoint, the client
              requests <spanx style="verb">download</spanx> scope on the
              requesting party's behalf. The authorization server determines
              the contents of the following sets:
              <spanx>RequestedScopes</spanx>(<spanx
              style="verb">album</spanx>) containing <spanx
              style="verb">edit</spanx> and <spanx
              style="verb">download</spanx>,
              <spanx>RequestedScopes</spanx>(<spanx
              style="verb">photo1</spanx>) containing <spanx
              style="verb">view</spanx> and <spanx
              style="verb">download</spanx>, and
              <spanx>RequestedScopes</spanx>(<spanx
              style="verb">photo2</spanx>) containing <spanx
              style="verb">view</spanx> and <spanx
              style="verb">download</spanx>.</t>

              <t>The resource owner has set policy conditions that allow
              access by this particular requesting party only to <spanx
              style="verb">photo1</spanx> and only for <spanx
              style="verb">view</spanx> scope.</t>

              <t>Based on the authorization server's authorization assessment
              calculation, it determines the contents of the following sets:
              <spanx>CandidateGrantedScopes</spanx>(<spanx
              style="verb">album</spanx>) containing no scopes,
              <spanx>CandidateGrantedScopes</spanx>(<spanx
              style="verb">photo1</spanx>) containing <spanx
              style="verb">view</spanx>, and
              <spanx>CandidateGrantedScopes</spanx>(<spanx
              style="verb">photo2</spanx>) containing no scopes. This adds up
              to less than in the corresponding <spanx>RequestedScopes</spanx>
              sets. The authorization server therefore has a choice whether to
              issue an RPT (in this case, containing a permission for <spanx
              style="verb">photo1</spanx> with <spanx
              style="verb">view</spanx> scope) or an error (say, <spanx
              style="verb">request_denied</spanx>, or <spanx
              style="verb">request_submitted</spanx> if has a way to notify
              the resource owner about the album editing resource request and
              seek an added policy covering it).</t>

              optimize future authorization processes on behalf of a
              requesting party. The PCT MUST be unguessable by an attacker.
              The PCT MUST NOT disclose claims from the requesting party
              directly to possessors of the PCT. Instead, such claims SHOULD
              be associated by reference to the PCT or expressed in an

              server that issued the PCT. See <xref target="claim-redirect" />
              for more information about the end-user requesting party
              interaction option. See <xref target="sec-consid-exposure" />

              <t hangText="upgraded">OPTIONAL. Boolean value. If the client

              includes the permissions of the RPT from the request as part of
              the newly issued RPT, then it MUST set this value to <spanx
              style="verb">true</spanx>. If it sets the value to <spanx
              style="verb">false</spanx> or the value is absent, the client
              MUST act as if the newly issued RPT does not include the
              permissions associated with the RPT from the request. (See <xref

    <section anchor="sec-consid" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This specification relies mainly on OAuth 2.0 security mechanisms as
      well as transport-level security. Thus, implementers are strongly
      advised to read <xref target="BCP195" /> and the security considerations
      in <xref target="RFC6749" /> (Section 10) and <xref target="RFC6750" />
      (Section 5) along with the security considerations of any other OAuth
      token-defining specifications in use, along with the entire <xref
      target="RFC6819" /> specification, and apply the countermeasures
      described therein. As well, implementers should take into account the
      security considerations in all other normatively referenced
      specifications.</t>

      <t>The following sections describe additional security
      considerations.</t>

      <section anchor="csrf" title="Cross-Site Request Forgery">
        <t>Redirection used for gathering claims interactively from an
        end-user requesting party (described in <xref
        target="claim-redirect" />) creates the potential for cross-site
        request forgery (CSRF). This may be the result of an open redirect if
        the authorization server does not force the client to pre-register its
        claims redirection endpoint, and server-side artifact tampering if the
        client does not avail itself of the <spanx style="verb">state</spanx>
        parameter.</t>

        <t>A CSRF attack against the authorization server's claims interaction
        endpoint can result in an attacker obtaining authorization for access
        through a malicious client without involving or alerting the end-user
        requesting party. The authorization server MUST implement CSRF
        protection for its claims interaction endpoint and ensure that a
        malicious client cannot obtain authorization without the awareness and
        involvement of the requesting party.</t>

        <t>If the client uses the interactive claims gathering feature, it
        MUST implement CSRF protection for its claims redirection URI. It
        SHOULD use the <spanx style="verb">state</spanx> parameter when
        redirecting the requesting party to the claims interaction endpoint.
        The value of the <spanx style="verb">state</spanx> parameter MUST be
        unguessable by an attacker. Once the authorization server redirects
        the requesting party back, with the required binding value contained
        in the <spanx style="verb">state</spanx> parameter, the client MUST
        check that the value of the <spanx style="verb">state</spanx>
        parameter received is equal to the value sent in the initial
        redirection request. Depending on the type of application, a client
        has several methods for storing and later verifying the value of the
        <spanx style="verb">state</spanx> parameter in between the initial
        redirect and the eventual resulting request to the claims redirection
        URI, including storage in a server-side session-bound variable,
        cryptographic derivation from a browser cookie, or secure
        application-level storage. The client MUST treat requests containing
        an invalid or unknown <spanx style="verb">state</spanx> parameter
        value as an error.</t>

        <t>The <spanx style="verb">state</spanx> parameter SHOULD NOT include
        sensitive client or requesting party information in plain text, as it
        is transmitted through third-party components (the requesting party's
        user agent) and could be stored insecurely.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="sec-consid-exposure" title="RPT and PCT Exposure">
        <t>When a client redirects an end-user requesting party to the claims
        interaction endpoint, the client provides no a priori context to the
        authorization server about which user is appearing at the endpoint,
        other than implicitly through the permission ticket. Thus, a malicious
        client has the opportunity to switch end-users -- say, enabling
        malicious end-user Carlos to impersonate legitimate end-user Bob, who
        might be represented by a PCT already in that client's possession and
        might even have authorized the issuance of that PCT -- after the
        redirect completes and before it returns to the token endpoint to seek
        permissions.</t>

        <t>To mitigate this threat, the authorization server, with the support
        of the resource owner, should consider the following strategies in
        combination.<list style="symbols">
            <t>Require that the requesting party legitimately represent the
            wielder of the RPT on a legal or contractual level. This solution
            alone does not reduce the risk from a technical perspective.</t>

            <t>Gather claims interactively from an end-user requesting party
            that demonstrate that some sufficiently strong level of
            authentication was performed.</t>

            <t>Require claims to have a high degree of freshness in order for
            them to satify policy conditions.</t>

            <t>Tighten time-to-live strategies around RPTs and their
            associated permissions (see <xref target="ttl" />).</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The client MUST only share the RPT (access token) with the resource
        server and authorization server, as explained in Section 10.3 of <xref
        target="RFC6749" />, and thus MUST keep it confidential from the
        requesting party. Because a malicious requesting party (the user of
        the client in the UMA grant) may have incentives to steal an RPT that
        the resource owner (the user of the client in other OAuth grants) does
        not, this security consideration takes on especial importance.</t>

        <t>The PCT is similar to a refresh token in that it allows
        non-interactive issuance of access tokens. The authorization server
        and client MUST keep the PCT confidential in transit and storage, and
        MUST NOT share the PCT with any entity other than each other. The
        authorization server MUST maintain the binding between the PCT and the
        client to which it was issued.</t>

        <t>Given that the PCT represents a set of requesting party claims, a
        client supplying a PCT in its RPT request MUST make a best effort to
        ensure that the requesting party using the client now is the same as
        the requesting party that was associated with the PCT when it was
        issued. Different clients will have different capabilities in this
        respect; for example, some applications are single-user and perform no
        local authentication, associating all PCTs with the "current user",
        while others might have more sophisticated authentication and user
        mapping capabilities.</t>

        <t>If the authorization server has reason to believe that a PCT is
        compromised, for example, if the PCT has been supplied by a client
        that has "impossible geography" parameters, the authorization server
        should consider not using the claims based on that PCT in its
        authorization assessment.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="pop"
               title="Strengthening RPT Protection Using Proof of Possession">
        <t>After the client's resource request with an RPT, assuming the
        client sent an RPT of the bearer style such as defined in <xref
        target="RFC6750" />, the resource server will have received from the
        client the entire secret portion of the token. This specification
        assumes only bearer-type tokens because they are the only type
        standardized as of this specification's publication. However, to
        strengthen protection for RPTs using a proof-of-possession approach,
        the resource server could receive an RPT that consists of only a
        cryptographically signed token identifier, and then to validate the
        signature, it could, for example, submit the token identifier to the
        token introspection endpoint to obtain the necessary key information.
        The details of this usage are outside the scope of this
        specification.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="cred-guessing" title="Credentials-Guessing">
        <t>Permission tickets and PCTs are additional credentials that the
        authorization server MUST prevent attackers from guessing, as defined
        in Section 10.10 of <xref target="RFC6749" />.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="ticket-management" title="Permission Ticket Management">
        <t>Within the constraints of making permission ticket values
        unguessable, the authorization server MAY format the permission ticket
        however it chooses, for example, either as a random string that
        references data held on the server or by including data within the
        ticket itself.</t>

        <t>Permission tickets MUST be single-use. This prevents susceptibility
        to a session fixation attack.</t>

        <t>The authorization server MUST invalidate a permission ticket when
        the client presents the permission ticket to either the token endpoint
        or the claims interaction endpoint, or when the permission ticket
        expires, whichever occurs first.</t>

        <t>The client SHOULD check that the value of the <spanx
        style="verb">ticket</spanx> parameter it receives back from the
        authorization server in each response and each redirect of the
        requesting party back to it differs from the one it sent to the server
        in the initial request or redirect.</t>

        <t>If the authorization server has reason to believe that a permission
        ticket is compromised, for example, because it has seen the permission
        ticket before and it believes the first appearance was from a
        legitimate client and the second appearance is from an attacker, it
        should consider invalidating any access tokens based on this
        evidence.</t>

        <t>Given that scenarios involving the <spanx
        style="verb">request_submitted</spanx> error code are likely to
        involve polling intervals, the permission ticket needs to last long
        enough to give the client a chance to attempt a polling request, which
        then needs to figure into other permission ticket security
        considerations.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="default-deny"
               title="Naive Implementations of Default-Deny Authorization">
        <t>While a reasonable approach for most scenarios is to implement the
        classic stance of default-deny ("everything that is not expressly
        allowed is forbidden"), corner cases can inadvertently result in
        default-permit behavior. For example, it is insufficient to create
        default "empty" policy conditions stating "no claims are needed", and
        then accept an empty set of supplied claims as sufficient for access
        during authorization assessment.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="trust-push"
               title="Requirements for Pre-Established Trust Regarding Claim Tokens">
        <t>When a client makes an RPT request, it has the opportunity to push
        a claim token to attempt to satisfy policy conditions (see <xref
        target="uma-grant-type" />).</t>

        <t>Claim tokens of any format typically contain audience restrictions,
        and an authorization server would not typically be in the primary
        audience for a claim token held or generated by a client. It is
        RECOMMENDED to document how the client, authorization server,
        requesting party, and any additional ecosystem entities and parties
        will establish a trust relationship and communicate any required
        keying material in a claim token profile, as described in <xref
        target="profiles" />. Authorization servers are RECOMMENDED not to
        accept claim tokens pushed by untrusted clients and not to ignore
        audience restrictions found in claim tokens pushed by clients.</t>

        <t>A malicious client could push a claim token to the authorization
        server (revealing the claims therein; see <xref
        target="rqp-privacy" />) to seek resource access on its own behalf
        prior to any opportunity for an end-user requesting party to authorize
        claims collection. It is RECOMMENDED either for trust relationships
        established by the ecosystem parties to include prior requesting party
        authorization as required, or for end-user requesting party
        authorization to be gathered interactively prior to claims pushing, as
        described in <xref target="claim-redirect" />.</t>

        <t>Some deployments could have exceptional circumstances allowing the
        authorization server to validate claim tokens. For example, if the
        authorization server itself is also the identity provider for the
        requesting party, then it would be able to validate any ID token that
        the client pushes as a claim token and also validate the client to
        which it was issued.</t>

        OAuth client credentials are all subject to management. Different
        time-to-live strategies might be suitable for different resources and
        scopes.</t>

        <t>In order to account for modifications of policy conditions that
        result in the withdrawal of authorization grants (for example, fewer
        scopes, fewer resources, or resources available for a shorter time) in
        as timely a fashion as possible, the authorization server should align
        its strategies for management of these factors with resource owner
        needs and actions rather than those of clients and requesting parties.
        For example, the authorization server may want to invalidate a
        client's RPT and refresh token as soon as a resource owner changes
        policy conditions in such a way as to deny the client and its
        requesting party future access to a full set of previously held
        permissions.</t>

      <section anchor="rqp-privacy"
               title="Requesting Party Information at the Authorization Server">
        <t>Claims are likely to contain personal, personally identifiable, and
        sensitive information, particularly in the case of requesting parties
        who are end-users.</t>

        <t>If the authorization server supports persisting claims for any
        length of time (for example, to support issuance of PCTs), then it
        SHOULD provide a secure and privacy-protected means of storing claim
        data. It is also RECOMMENDED for the authorization server to use an
        interactive claims-gathering flow to ask an end-user requesting party
        for authorization to collect any claims subsequently and to persist
        their claims (for example, before issuing a PCT), if no prior
        requesting party authorization has been established among the
        ecosystem parties (see <xref target="trust-push" />).</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Resource Owner Information at the Resource Server">
        <t>Since the client's initial request for a protected resource is made
        in an unauthorized and unauthenticated context, such requests are by
        definition open to all users. The response to that request includes
        the authorization server's location to enable the client to request an
        access token and present claims. If it is known out of band that
        authorization server is owned and controlled by a single user, or
        visiting the authorization server contains other identifying
        information, then an unauthenticated and unauthorized client would be
        able to tell which resource owner is associated with a given resource.
        Other information about the resource owner, such as organizational
        affiliation or group membership, may be gained from this transaction
        as well.</t>
