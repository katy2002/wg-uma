      <t>User-Managed Access (UMA) is a profile of OAuth 2.0. UMA defines how
      resource owners can control protected-resource access by clients
      operated by arbitrary requesting parties, where the resources reside on
      any number of resource servers, and where a centralized authorization
      server governs access based on resource owner policy.</t>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>User-Managed Access (UMA) is a profile of OAuth 2.0 <xref
      target="OAuth2"></xref>. UMA defines how resource owners can control
      protected-resource access by clients operated by arbitrary requesting
      parties, where the resources reside on any number of resource servers,
      and where a centralized authorization server governs access based on
      resource owner policy. Resource owners configure authorization servers
      with access policies that serve as implicit authorization grants. Thus,
      the UMA profile of OAuth includes an authorization grant flow.</t>

      <t>UMA serves numerous use cases where a resource owner outsources
      authorization for access to their resources, potentially even without
      the run-time presence of the resource owner. A typical example is the
      following: a web user (an end-user resource owner) can authorize a web
      app (client) to gain one-time or ongoing access to a protected resource
      containing his home address stored at a "personal data store" service
      (resource server), by telling the resource server to respect access
      entitlements issued by his chosen cloud-based authorization service
      (authorization server). The requesting party operating the client might
      be the resource owner himself, using a web or native app run by an
      e-commerce company that needs to know where to ship a purchased item, or
      it might be his friend who is using an online address book service to
      collect contact information, or it might be a survey company that uses
      an autonomous web service to compile population demographics. A variety
      of scenarios and use cases can be found in <xref
      target="UMA-usecases"></xref> and <xref
      target="UMA-casestudies"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Practical control of access among loosely coupled parties requires
      more than just messaging protocols. This specification defines only the
      technical "contract" between UMA-conforming entities; its companion
      Binding Obligations specification <xref target="UMA-obligations"></xref>
      defines the expected behaviors of parties operating and using these
      entities. Parties operating entities that claim to be UMA-conforming
      MUST provide documentation affirmatively stating their acceptance of the
      binding obligations contractual framework defined in the Binding
      Obligations specification.</t>

      <t>In enterprise settings, application access management sometimes
      involves letting back-office applications serve only as policy
      enforcement points (PEPs), depending entirely on access decisions coming
      from a central policy decision point (PDP) to govern the access they
      give to requesters. This separation eases auditing and allows policy
      administration to scale in several dimensions. UMA makes use of a
      separation similar to this, letting the resource owner serve as a policy
      administrator crafting authorization strategies for resources under
      their control.</t>

      <t>In order to increase interoperable communication among the
      authorization server, resource server, and client, UMA defines several
      purpose-built APIs related to the outsourcing of authorization,
      themselves protected by OAuth in embedded fashion.</t>

      <t>The UMA protocol has three broad phases, as shown in <xref
      target="UMA-phases"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The phases work as follows: <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Protect a resource">(Described in <xref
          target="protecting-a-resource"></xref>.) The resource owner, who
          manages online resources at the resource server ("A"), introduces it
          to the authorization server so that the latter can begin controlling
          the resources' protection. To accomplish this protection, the
          authorization server presents a protection API ("C") to the resource
          server. This API is OAuth-protected and requires a protection API
          token (PAT) for access. The API consists of an OAuth resource set
          registration endpoint as defined by <xref
          target="OAuth-resource-reg"></xref>, an endpoint for registering
          client-requested permissions, and an OAuth token introspection
          endpoint as defined by <xref target="OAuth-introspection"></xref>.
          Out of band, the resource owner configures the authorization server
          with policies associated with the registered resource sets
          ("B").</t>

          <t hangText="Get authorization">(Described in <xref
          target="getting-authz-accessing-resource"></xref>.) The client
          approaches the resource server seeking access to a protected
          resource. In order to access it successfully, the client must first
          use the authorization server's authorization API ("D") to obtain a
          requesting party token (RPT) on behalf of its requesting party, and
          the requesting party must supply to the authorization server any
          identity claims needed in order for the server to associate
          sufficient authorization data with that RPT. The API is
          OAuth-protected and requires an authorization API token (AAT) for
          access. The API consists of an RPT issuance endpoint and an
          authorization request endpoint.</t>

          <t hangText="Access a resource">(Described along with Phase 2 in
          <xref target="getting-authz-accessing-resource"></xref>.) The client
          successfully presents an RPT that has sufficient authorization data
          associated with it to the resource server, gaining access to the
          desired resource ("E"). In this sense, this phase is the "happy
          path" within phase 2. The nature of the authorization data varies
          according to the RPT profile in use.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Implementers are anticipated to develop profiles (see <xref
      target="profiles"></xref>) that specify and restrict various UMA
      protocol, RPT, and identity claim options, according to deployment and
      usage conditions.</t>

      <section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">
        <t>UMA introduces the following new terms and enhancements of OAuth
        term definitions.<list hangIndent="6" style="hanging">
            <t hangText="resource owner"><vspace />An OAuth resource that is
            the "user" in User-Managed Access. This is typically an end-user
            (a natural person) but it can also be a corporation or other legal
            person.</t>

            <t hangText="requesting party"><vspace />An end-user, or a
            corporation or other legal person, that uses a client to seek
            access to a protected resource. The requesting party may or may
            not be the same party as the resource owner.</t>

            <t hangText="client"><vspace />An application making protected
            resource requests with the resource owner's authorization and on
            the requesting party's behalf.</t>

            <t hangText="claim"><vspace />A statement of the value or values
            of one or more identity attributes of a requesting party. A
            requesting party may need to provide claims to an authorization
            server in order to satisfy policy and gain permission for access
            to a protected resource.</t>

            <t hangText="resource set">A set of one or more protected
            resources. In authorization policy terminology, a resource set is
            the "object" being protected.</t>

            <t hangText="scope">A bounded extent of access that is possible to
            perform on a resource set. In authorization policy terminology, a
            scope is one of the potentially many "verbs" that can logically
            apply to a resource set ("object"). UMA associates scopes with
            labeled resource sets.</t>

            <t hangText="authorization data">Data associated with a requesting
            party token that enables some combination of the authorization
            server and resource server to determine the correct extent of
            access to allow to a client. Authorization data is a key part of
            the definition of an RPT profile.</t>

            <t hangText="permission">A scope of access over a particular
            resource set at a particular resource server that is being
            requested by, or granted to, a requesting party. In authorization
            policy terminology, a permission is an entitlement that includes a
            "subject" (requesting party), "verbs" (one or more scopes of
            access), and an "object" (resource set). A permission is one
            example of authorization data that an authorization server may
            issue.</t>

            <t hangText="permission ticket">A correlation handle that is
            conveyed from an authorization server to a resource server, from a
            resource server to a client, and ultimately from a client to an
            authorization server, to enable the authorization server to assess
            the correct resource owner policies to apply to a request for an
            authorization grant.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="endpoint-discussion" title="APIs and Protection">
        <t>UMA involves three APIs, all of which are protected.</t>

        <t>The authorization server has the opportunity to manage the validity
        periods of access tokens that it issues, their corresponding refresh
        tokens where applicable, the individual data components associated
        with RPTs where applicable, and even the client credentials that it
        issues. Different time-to-live strategies may be suitable for
        different resources and scopes of access, and the authorization server
        has the opportunity to give the resource owner control over lifetimes
        of tokens and authorization data issued on their behalf through
        policy. These options are all outside the scope of this
        specification.</t>

        <section title="Protection and Authorization APIs at the Authorization Server">
          <t>The authorization server presents a protection API to the
          resource server and an authorization API to the client. These APIs
          MUST be OAuth-protected; thus, the authorization server has an OAuth
          token endpoint and user authorization endpoint, and has the option
          to issue an OAuth refresh token along with any access tokens issued
          for these APIs.</t>

          <t>The protection API consists of an OAuth resource set registration
          endpoint as defined by <xref target="OAuth-resource-reg"></xref>, an
          endpoint for registering client-requested permissions, and an OAuth
          token introspection endpoint as defined by <xref
          target="OAuth-introspection"></xref>. This specification profiles
          the endpoints defined by these other specifications.</t>

          <t>The authorization API consists of an RPT issuance endpoint and an
          authorization request endpoint.</t>

          <t>All endpoint URIs SHOULD require the use of a transport-layer
          security mechanism such as TLS. The authorization server MUST
          declare all of its endpoints in its configuration data (see <xref
          target="am-endpoints"></xref>).</t>

          <t>An entity seeking protection API access MUST request the scope
          "http://docs.kantarainitiative.org/uma/scopes/prot.json", and an
          access token with at least this scope is called a protection API
          token (PAT). An entity seeking authorization API access MUST request
          the scope "http://docs.kantarainitiative.org/uma/scopes/authz.json",
          and an access token with at least this scope is called an
          authorization API token (AAT). The same entity can serve in both
          roles, so that an OAuth access token might be considered both a PAT
          and an AAT if it has both scopes. If a request to an endpoint fails
          due to an invalid, missing, or expired PAT or AAT, or requires
          higher privileges at this endpoint than provided by the PAT or AAT,
          the authorization server responds with an OAuth error.</t>

          <t>Note: These scope keywords are URIs that resolve to JSON-encoded
          scope descriptions, as defined in <xref
          target="OAuth-resource-reg"></xref>. These scope descriptions are
          non-normative for the purposes of PATs and AATs.</t>

          <t>The authorization server is REQUIRED to support the OAuth bearer
          token profile for PAT and AAT issuance, and MAY support other OAuth
          token profiles for these purposes. It MUST declare all supported
          token profiles for PAT and AAT issuance in its configuration data.
          The authorization server MAY support the use of any OAuth grant type
          for PAT and AAT issuance, but MUST support the authorization_code
          grant type, and SHOULD support the SAML bearer token grant type
          <xref target="OAuth-SAML"></xref>
          (urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:saml2-bearer) if it anticipates
          working with entities that are operating in environments where the
          use of SAML is prevalent. It MUST declare its supported grant types
          for PAT and AAT issuance in its configuration data.</t>

          <t>A PAT binds a resource owner, a resource server the owner uses
          for resource management, and an authorization server the owner uses
          for protection of resources at this resource server. It is not
          specific to any client or requesting party. The issuance of a PAT
          represents the approval of the resource owner for this resource
          server to trust this authorization server for protecting its
          resources belonging to this resource owner.</t>

          <t>An AAT binds a requesting party, a client being used by that
          party, and an authorization server that protects resources this
          client is seeking access to on this requesting party's behalf. It is
          not specific to any resource server or resource owner. The issuance
          of an AAT represents the approval of this requesting party for this
          client to engage with this authorization server to supply claims,
          ask for authorization, and perform any other tasks needed for
          obtaining authorization for access to resources at all resource
          servers that use this authorization server. The authorization server
          is able to manage future processes of authorization and
          claims-caching efficiently for this client/requesting party pair
          across all resource servers they try to access. These management
          processes are outside the scope of this specification, however.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="API at the Resource Server">
          <t>The resource server presents one or more protected resource
          endpoints to the client; these endpoints are protected by the UMA
          profile of OAuth and require a requesting party token (RPT) with
          sufficient authorization data for access. This specification defines
          one RPT profile, call "bearer" (see <xref
          target="uma-bearer-token-profile"></xref>), which is REQUIRED for
          the authorization server to support. It MAY support additional RPT
          profiles. It MUST declare all supported RPT profiles in its
          configuration data.</t>

          <t>An RPT represents a binding of a requesting party, the client
          being used by that party, the resource server at which protected
          resources of interest reside, and the authorization server that
          protects those resources. It is not specific to a single resource
          owner, though its internal components are likely to be bound to
          individual resource owners, depending on the RPT profile in use.</t>

            token profiles supported by this authorization server for RPT
            issuance. The property value is an array of string values, where
            each string value is either a reserved keyword defined in this
            specification or a URI identifying an access token profile defined
            elsewhere. The reserved keyword "bearer" as a value for this
            property stands for the UMA bearer RPT profile defined in <xref

      <t>The resource owner, resource server, and authorization server perform
      the following actions to put resources under protection. This list
      assumes that the resource server has discovered the authorization
      server's configuration data and endpoints as needed.<list
          style="numbers">
          <t>The authorization server issues client credentials to the
          resource server. It is OPTIONAL for the client credentials to be
          provided dynamically through <xref target="DynClientReg"></xref>);
          alternatively, they MAY use a static process.</t>

          <t>The resource server acquires a PAT from the authorization server
          in order to use the resource set registration endpoint (and later,
          other protection API endpoints). It is OPTIONAL for the resource
          owner to introduce the resource server to the authorization server
          dynamically (for example, through a "NASCAR"-style user interface
          where the resource owner selects a chosen authorization server);
          alternatively, they MAY use a static process that may or may not
          directly involve the resource owner at introduction time.</t>

          <t>In an ongoing fashion, the resource server registers any resource
          sets with the authorization server for which it intends to outsource
          protection, using the process defined by <xref
          target="OAuth-resource-reg"></xref>.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Note: The resource server is free to offer the option to protect any
      subset of the resource owner's resources using different authorization
      servers or other means entirely, or to protect some resources and not
      others. Additionally, the choice of protection regimes can be made
      explicitly by the resource owner or implicitly by the resource server.
      Any such partitioning by the resource server or owner is outside the
      scope of this specification.</t>

      <t>Once a resource set has been placed under authorization server
      protection through the registration of a resource set description for
      it, and until such a description's deletion by the resource server, the
      resource server MUST limit access to corresponding resources, respecting
      authorization data associated with client-presented RPTs by the
      authorization server as appropriate (see <xref
      target="client-presents-rpt"></xref>).</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="getting-authz-accessing-resource"
             title="Getting Authorization and Accessing a Resource">
      <t>An authorization server orchestrates and controls clients' access (on
      their requesting parties' behalf) to a resource owner's protected
      resources at a resource server, under conditions dictated by that
      resource owner.</t>

      <t>The process of getting authorization and accessing a resource always
      begins with the client attempting access at a protected resource
      endpoint at the resource server. How the client came to learn about this
      endpoint is out of scope for this specification. The resource owner
      might, for example, have advertised its availability publicly on a blog
      or other website, listed it in a discovery service, or emailed a link to
      a particular intended requesting party.</t>

      <t>The resource server responds to the client's access request in one of
      several ways depending on the circumstances of the request, either
      immediately or having first performed one or more embedded interactions
      with the authorization server. Depending on the nature of the resource
      server's response to an failed access attempt, the client and its
      requesting party engage in embedded interactions with the authorization
      server before re-attempting access.</t>

      <t>The interactions are as follows. Each interaction MAY be the last, if
      the client chooses not to continue pursuing the access attempt or the
      resource server chooses not to continue facilitating it.<list
          style="symbols">
          <t>The client attempts to access a protected resource.<list

              <t>If the access attempt is unaccompanied by an RPT, the
              resource server responds immediately with an HTTP 401
              (Unauthorized) response and instructions on where to go to
              obtain one.</t>

              <t>If the access attempt was accompanied by an RPT, the resource
              server checks the RPT's status.<list style="symbols">
                  <t>If the RPT is invalid, the resource server responds with
                  an HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) response and instructions on
                  where to go to obtain a token.</t>

                  <t>If the RPT is valid but has insufficient authorization
                  data, the resource server registers a suitable requested
                  permission on the client's behalf at the authorization
                  server, and then responds to the client with an HTTP 403
                  (Forbidden) response and instructions on where to go to ask
                  for authorization.</t>

                  <t>If the RPT is valid, and if the authorization data
                  associated with the token is sufficient for allowing access,
                  the resource server responds with an HTTP 200 (OK) response
                  and a representation of the resource.</t>
                </list></t>
            </list></t>

          <t>If the client (possessing no RPT or an invalid RPT) received a
          401 response and an authorization server's location, after looking
          up its configuration data and endpoints as necessary, it requests an
          RPT from the RPT endpoint.</t>

          <t>If the client (posessing a valid RPT) received a 403 response and
          a permission ticket, it asks the authorization server for
          authorization data that matches the ticket. If the authorization
          server needs requesting party claims in order to assess this
          client's authorization, it engages in a claims-gathering flow with
          the requesting party.<list style="symbols">
              <t>If the client does not already have an AAT at the appropriate
              authorization server to be able to use its authorization API, it

        <t>This interaction assumes that the resource server has previously
        registered one or more resource sets that correspond to the resource
        to which access is being attempted.</t>

        <t>The client attempts to access a protected resource (for example,
        when an end-user requesting party clicks on a thumbnail representation
        of the resource to retrieve a larger version). It is expected to
        discover, or be provisioned or configured with, knowledge of the
        protected resource and its location out of band. Further, the client
        is expected to acquire its own knowledge about the
        application-specific methods made available by the resource server for
        operating on this protected resource (such as viewing it with a GET
        method, or transforming it with some complex API call) and the
        possible scopes of access.</t>

        <t>In response to receiving an access request accompanied by an RPT
        that has insufficient authorization data, the resource server
        registers a permission with the authorization server that would be
        sufficient for the type of access sought. The authorization server
        returns a permission ticket for the resource server to give to the
        client in its response.</t>

        <t>The permission ticket is a short-lived opaque structure whose form
        is determined by the authorization server. The ticket value MUST be
        securely random (for example, not merely part of a predictable
        sequential series), to avoid denial-of-service attacks. Since the
        ticket is an opaque structure from the point of view of the client,
        the authorization server is free to include information regarding
        expiration time within the opaque ticket for its own consumption. When
        the client subsequently asks the authorization server for
        authorization data to be associated with its RPT, it will submit this
        ticket to the authorization server.</t>

        <t>The resource server registers the requested permission using the
        POST method at the authorization server's permission registration
        endpoint. The resource server MUST provide its valid PAT in order to
        get access to this endpoint. The body of the HTTP request message
        contains a JSON object providing the requested permission, using a
        format derived from the scope description format specified in <xref
        target="OAuth-resource-reg"></xref>, as follows. The object has the
        following properties:<list style="hanging">

        <t>The resource server determines a received RPT's status, including
        both its validity and, if valid, its associated authorization data,
        before giving or refusing access to the client. An RPT is associated
        with a set of authorization data that governs whether the client is
        authorized for access. The token's nature and format are dictated by
        its profile; the profile might allow it to be self-contained, such
        that the resource server is able to determine its status locally, or
        might require or allow the resource server to make a run-time
        introspection request of the authorization server that issued the
        token.</t>

        <t>This specification makes one type of RPT mandatory to implement:
        the UMA bearer token profile, as defined in <xref

          <t>Within any RPT profile, when a resource server needs to

          status, it MUST use the authorization server's OAuth introspection
          endpoint, defined by <xref target="OAuth-introspection"></xref>. Any
          UMA token profile MAY require, allow, or prohibit use of the token
          introspection endpoint, and MAY profile its usage. The authorization
          server MUST OAuth-protect this endpoint and require a PAT from the
          resource server for access to it. The resource server MUST use the
          POST method in interacting with the endpoint, not the GET method

          <t>On receiving an RPT of the "Bearer" type in an authorization
          header from a client making an access attempt, the resource server
          MUST introspect the token by using the authorization server's token
          introspection endpoint. The PAT used by the resource server to make
          the introspection request provides resource-owner context to the
          authorization server.</t>

          the valid property has a "true" value, then the JSON object MUST
          also contain an extension property with the name "permissions" that

               title="Client Seeks Authorization for Access">
        <t>In order to access a protected resource successfully, a client
        needs to present a valid RPT with sufficient authorization data for
        access. To get to this stage requires a number of previously
        successful steps:<list style="numbers">
            <t>The authorization server issues client credentials to the
            client. It is OPTIONAL for the client credentials to be provided
            dynamically through <xref target="DynClientReg"></xref>);
            alternatively, they MAY use a static process.</t>

            <t>The client acquires an AAT. This enables it to use
            authorization API endpoints.</t>

            <t>The client acquires an RPT from the RPT endpoint. See <xref
            target="authz-permission-token"></xref> for more detail.</t>

            <t>The client asks for authorization at the authorization request
            endpoint, providing the permission ticket it got from the resource
            server. The authorization server associates authorization data
            with the client's RPT based on the permission ticket, the resource
            owner's operative policies, and the results of any
            claims-gathering flows with the requesting party. See <xref
            target="r-am-authz-scope"></xref> for more detail.</t>
          </list></t>

        <section anchor="authz-permission-token" title="Client Obtains RPT">
          <t>The client might need an RPT if it has never before requested an
          RPT for this combination of requesting party, resource server, and
          authorization server, or if it has lost control of a previously
          issued RPT and needs a refreshed one. It obtains an RPT by
          performing a POST on the RPT endpoint. It MUST provide its own valid
          AAT in the header.</t>

          <t>The authorization server responds with an HTTP 201 (Created)

          <t>If the AAT provided in the header is the same as one provided for
          a previously issued still-valid RPT by this authorization server,
          the authorization server invalidates the old RPT and issues a new
          one.</t>

          <t>On first issuance, the RPT is associated with no authorization
          data and thus does not convey any authorizations for access.</t>

          RPT that applies to this requesting party for this resource server
          and this authorization server, and a permission ticket, the client
          asks the authorization server to give it suitable authorization data
          for the sought-for access. It performs a POST on the authorization
          request endpoint, supplying its own AAT in the header and its RPT
          and the permission ticket in a JSON object with properties "rpt" and
          ticket", respectively.</t>

          <figure>
            <preamble>Example of a request message containing an AAT, an RPT,

}]]></artwork>
          </figure>

          <t>The authorization server uses the ticket to look up the details
          of the previously registered requested permission, maps the
          requested permission to operative resource owner policies based on
          the resource set identifier and scopes in it, undergoes any
          claims-gathering flows required (see <xref
          target="authz-flows"></xref>), and ultimately responds to the
          request. The resource owner's policies at the authorization server
          amount to an implicit authorization grant in governing the issuance
          of authorization data. (The authorization server is also free to
          enable the resource owner to set policies that require the owner to
          provide a run-time authorization grant in the form of a consent
          interaction, mediated by the authorization server. This setting of
          policies and gathering of consent is outside the scope of this
          specification.)</t>

          <t>The authorization server MUST base the addition of authorization
          data to RPTs on user policies. The nature of these policies is
          outside the scope of UMA, but generally speaking, they can be
          thought of as either independent of requesting-party features (for
          example, time of day) or dependent on requesting-party features (for
          example, whether they are over 18). Such requesting-party features
          can potentially be collected in a claims-gathering flow. If the
          authorization server does not add the requested authorization data,
          it responds using the appropriate HTTP status code and UMA error
          code (see <xref target="uma-error-response"></xref>): <list

              (Forbidden) status code. The client is therefore not authorized,
              but has the opportunity to engage its operator -- the requesting

      <section anchor="authz-flows" title="Claims-Gathering Flows">
        <t>The process for requesting and providing claims is extensible and
        may have a variety of dependencies on the type of requesting party
        (for example, natural person or legal person) and the type of client
        (for example, browser, native app, or autonomously running web
        service). This specification provides a framework for handling
        end-user-driven clients and an optional "openid" claim profile, based
        on OpenID Connect, for gathering standardized claims from such an
        end-user. It also allows for the definition of additional claim
        profiles. The authorization server MAY support any number of claim
        profiles, and SHOULD document the claim profiles it supports its
        configuration data. For the business-level and legal implications of
        different claim profiles, see <xref
        target="UMA-obligations"></xref>.</t>

        <section anchor="trusted-claims-human-driven"
                 title="Claims-Gathering Flow for Clients Operated by End-Users">
          <t>A client, whether web-based or native, is operated by an end-user
          in one of two typical situations:<list style="symbols">
              <t>The requesting party is a natural person (for example, a
              friend of the resource owner); the requesting party may even be
              the resource owner herself.</t>

              <t>The requesting party is a legal person such as a corporation,
              and the end-user operating the client is acting as an agent of
              that legal person (for example, a customer support specialist
              representing a credit card company).</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>For convenience, this specification refers to the end-user as a
          "requesting end-user" to cover both cases, which differ only at the
          level of business agreements (and potentially law), rather than
          technology. The authorization server has a variety of options at
          this point for satisfying the resource owner's policy; this
          specification does not dictate a single answer. For example, the
          authorization server could require the requesting end-user to
          register for and/or log in to a local authorization server account,
          or fill in a questionnaire, or complete a purchase. It could even
          require several of these operations, where the order is treated as
          significant for evaluating resource owner policies. A variety of
          claim profiling can be defined to achieve these effects.</t>

          <t>An end-user-driven client MUST redirect the requesting end-user
          to the authorization server in order to continue the process of
          seeking authorization, including a URI query parameter with the name
          "ticket" whose value conveys the permission ticket for which the
          need_claims error was received; for example,
          "ticket=016f84e8-f9b9-11e0-bd6f-0021cc6004de".</t>

          <t>Each claim profile MUST provide the following capabilities:<list

      server and client as they interact with it, and that the resource server
      may give to the client.</t>

      <section anchor="oauth-error-response" title="OAuth Error Responses">
        <t>When a resource server or client attempts to access one of the
        authorization server endpoints or a client attempts to access a
        protected resource at the resource server, it has to make an
        authenticated request by including an OAuth access token in the HTTP
        request as described in <xref target="OAuth2"></xref> Section 7.2.</t>

        <t>If the request failed authentication, the authorization server or
        the resource server responds with an OAuth error message as described
        throughout <xref target="protecting-a-resource"></xref> and <xref

        <t>When a resource server or client attempts to access one of the

        protected resource at the resource server, if the request is
        successfully authenticated by OAuth means, but is invalid for another
        reason, the authorization server or resource server responds with an
        UMA error response by adding the following properties to the entity
        body of the HTTP response: <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="error">REQUIRED. A single error code. Values for this

    <section anchor="profiles" title="Specificying Additional Profiles">
      <t>This specification defines a protocol that has optional features. For
      interoperability and to serve particular deployment scenarios, including
      sector-specific ones such as healthcare or e-government, third parties
      may want to define profiles of UMA that restrict these options.</t>

      <t>Further, this specification creates extensibility points for RPT
      profiles and claim profiles, and third parties may likewise want to
      define their own. Different RPT profile could be used, for example, to
      change the dividing line between authorization server and resource
      server responsibilities in controlling access. Different claim profiles
      could be used to customize sector-specific or population-specific
      (individual vs. employee) claim types that drive the types of policies
      resource owners could set.</t>

      <t>It is not practical for this specification to standardize all desired
      profiles. However, to serve overall interoperability goals, the
      following sections provide guidelines for third parties that wish to
      specify UMA-related profiles.</t>

      <section title="Specifying Profiles of UMA">
        <t>It is RECOMMENDED that profiles of UMA document the following
        information:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>Specify a URI that uniquely identifies the profile.</t>

            <t>Identify the responsible author and provide postal or
            electronic contact information.</t>

            <t>Supply references to previously defined profiles that the
            profile updates or obsoletes.</t>

            <t>Specify the set of interactions between endpoint entites
            involved in the profile, calling out any restrictions on ordinary
            UMA-conformant operations and any extension properties used in
            message formats.</t>

            <t>Identify the legally responsible parties involved in each
            interaction and any new obligations imposed, in the fashion of
            <xref target="UMA-obligations"></xref>.</t>

            <t>Define any additional or changed error states.</t>

            <t>Supply any additional security and privacy considerations,
            including analysis of threats and description of

      </section>

      <section title="Specifying RPT Profiles">
        <t>It is RECOMMENDED that RPT profiles document the following
        information:</t>

        <t><list style="numbers">
            <t>Specify a URI that uniquely identifies the token profile.</t>

            <t>Identify the responsible author and provide postal or
            electronic contact information.</t>

            <t>Supply references to previously defined token profiles that the
            token profile updates or obsoletes.</t>

            <t>Specify the keyword to be used in HTTP Authorization headers
            with tokens conforming to this profile.</t>

            <t>Specify the syntax and semantics of the data that the
            authorization server associates with the token.</t>

            <t>Specify how the token data is associated with, contained
            within, and/or retrieved by means of, the on-the-wire token
            string.</t>

            <t>Specify processing rules for token data.</t>

            <t>Identify any restrictions on grant types to be used with the
            token profile.</t>

            <t>Define any additional or changed error states.</t>

            <t>Supply any additional security and privacy considerations.</t>

            <t>Specify any obligations specific to the token profile, in the

        <t>It is RECOMMENDED that claim profiles document the following
        information:<list style="numbers">
            <t>Specify a URI that uniquely identifies the claim profile.</t>

            <t>Identify the responsible author and provide postal or

      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This specification relies mainly on OAuth security mechanisms as well
      as transport-level encryption for protecting the protection and
      authorization API endpoints. Most PATs and AATs are likely to use OAuth
      bearer tokens. See <xref target="OAuth-threat"></xref> for more
      information.</t>

      <t>This specification defines a number of JSON-based data formats. As a
      subset of the JavaScript scripting language, JSON data SHOULD be
      consumed through a process that does not dynamically execute it as code,
      to avoid malicious code execution. One way to achieve this is to use a
      JavaScript interpreter rather than the built-in JavaScript eval()
      function.</t>

      <t>(More threat model and security considerations information to
      come.)</t>

      <t>For information about the technical, operational, and legal elements
      of trust establishment between UMA entities and parties, which affects
      security considerations, see <xref target="UMA-obligations"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Privacy Considerations">
      <t>The authorization server comes to be in possession of resource set
      information (such as names and icons) that may reveal information about
      the resource owner, which the authorization server's trust relationship
      with the resource server is assumed to accommodate. However, the client
      is a less-trusted party -- in fact, entirely untrustworthy until
      authorization data is associated with its RPT. This specification
      depends on <xref target="OAuth-resource-reg"></xref>, which recommends
      obscuring resource set identifiers in order to avoid leaking personally
      identifiable information to clients through the scope mechanism.</t>

      <t>(More privacy considerations information to come.)</t>

      <t>For information about the technical, operational, and legal elements
      of trust establishment between UMA entities and parties, which affects
      privacy considerations, see <xref target="UMA-obligations"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="conformance" title="Conformance">
      <t>This section outlines conformance requirements for various entities
      implementing UMA endpoints.</t>

      <t>This specification has dependencies on other specifications, as
      referenced under the normative references listed in this specification.
      Its dependencies on some specifications, such as OpenID Connect (<xref
      target="OCStandard"></xref> and <xref target="OCMessages"></xref>), are
      optional depending on whether the feature in question is used in the
      implementation.</t>

      <t>The authorization server's configuration data provides a
      machine-readable method for it to indicate certain of the conformance
      options it has chosen or supports. Several of the configuration data
      properties allow for indicating extension features. Where this
      specification does not already require optional features to be
      documented, it is RECOMMENDED that authorization server developers and
      deployers document any profiled or extended features explicitly and use
      configuration data to indicate their usage. See <xref
      target="am-endpoints"></xref> for information about providing and
      extending the configuration data.</t>
